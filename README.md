# Portainer Setup with Docker for Efficient Container Management

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for setting up Portainer, an open-source platform for managing Docker and Kubernetes environments. The configuration uses Docker Compose with Traefik to enable HTTPS, ensuring secure and efficient container orchestration. Additionally, this guide demonstrates how to add and manage multiple servers using Portainer.

By the end of this setup, you’ll be able to:
- Deploy Portainer using Docker Compose.
- Secure your Portainer instance with Traefik as a reverse proxy with HTTPS.
- Add and manage additional servers in Portainer.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you’ll need:
- A Linux server or VM with a public IP.
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose installed.
- A domain name pointed to your server.

This tutorial was demonstrated using an Azure VM with the domain `portainer.dev.softsweb.site`.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Directory and Docker Compose Setup

Create a working directory for Portainer and configure the necessary Docker Compose file:

```bash
cd /opt
mkdir portainer
cd portainer
nano docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Traefik Configuration
Ensure Traefik is running as an HTTPS reverse proxy. Set up the required configuration files in `/etc/traefik/`:

`traefik.yaml`: Traefik configuration.

### 3. Launch Portainer
Start Portainer and Traefik by creating the Docker network and launching the containers:

```bash
docker network create traefik
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Accessing Portainer
Once the setup is complete, access Portainer by visiting your domain (e.g., https://portainer.your.site) in a web browser. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Portainer admin account.

### 5. Adding Additional Servers
To manage multiple servers, use Portainer's "Endpoints" feature:

1. Navigate to the `Endpoints` section in the Portainer dashboard.
2. Add the necessary connection details for your remote server (e.g., Docker socket or agent URL).
3.  Deploy the Portainer agent on the remote server, if required.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check:

- Domain configuration in DNS.
- Docker and Traefik logs:

``` bash
Copy code
docker logs <container_id>
```
